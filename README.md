# Field Projection Theory (FPT)

A higher-dimensional field projection framework proposing that all observed mass, charge, force, and spacetime curvature are emergent effects of a fundamental field defined over a compactified higher-dimensional manifold.

This model treats particles and interactions as lower-dimensional projections of continuous field configurations in extra dimensions. While speculative, the structure respects gauge symmetry, variational principles, and existing QFT formalism.
